These are things we planned, but didn't get done, yet.

buttons:
    
    Should add the 'selected' state to the annotations, allowing the user to
    step through them.

report selection:

    figure out which report is visible, and make the buttons control *that*
    report if more than one report is visible, use the previous selection.
    Change selection when clicking report links as well.

annotation clicking:

    clicking an annotation makes it selected, until clicking the selected
    event.  users can use this to stop stepping through notes as well.

alignment of notes:

    when selecting a note, it should line up with the line it's annotating.
    Move the "states" pane up and down, and make sure the overflow is clipped.

more data:

    When a state is selected, we could apply mouseovers to variables that show
    their value within that state.
